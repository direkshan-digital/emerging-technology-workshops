# Emerging Technology Workshops
The Emerging Technology team has over 20 years experience working with clients to bridge the gap between new technology, mainstream software products and business problems. One way we do this is by running client workshops.  

There's typically three styles of workshop we run: [design](workshop-design/introduction.md), [hackday](workshop-hackday/introduction.md) or [sprint](workshop-sprint/introduction.md).
