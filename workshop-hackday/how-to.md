# How To Run A Hackday Workshop
Aims, what it's about etc...
A Hackday workshop will have a technology, a data set or a well defined problem to focus on that has been defined before the workshop. Hackdays are often run in groups of 2 or 3 developers, but can be done in two forms, either with each group are working independently or all groups working together in a coordinated project.

Small groups working independently is relatively easy to manage and does not require as much work prior to the workshop.  It also gives maximum scope for exploring different ideas. It is unlikely that any individual group will be able to take on the scope of work possible with a coordinated project.

Working on a coordinated project is much more difficult and relies on groups working well together and being able to breakdown the problem sufficiently that each group can work without holding each other up. The problem should be broken down, at least in outline, before the workshop.


## Attendees
All attendees should be developers. If non-developer subject matter experts are needed they should be included in the day as needed. Everyone involved in the workshop will be expected to be hands on.

## Requirements
* Power and wifi for all attendees


## Expected Outcome
Working prototypes.

## What to do before the workshop
* Think about how code is going to be shared during and after the workshop. This needs to be agreed with the client.
* Make sure the clients expectations of any prototype are realistic. It is nearly always the case that the prototype is throw away code and allows for testing and experimenting with data and technology. It can inform a production application, but is almost never the base of one.

## How to run the workshop
* Agree a schedule at the start of the workshop.  The schedule need to have at a minimum a fixed time for playbacks/demos at the end of each day. It is also possible to have playbacks before lunch if the group feels this is useful.

## What can go wrong
* Technical people turn up, but they are not hands-on developers.
* A strong character takes over the workshop and directs it down a path they believe is right.
* Often, as with any development project, initial work is slow before making rapid progress at the end.
* Expectation that the final prototype is close to a production system.

## How to document
* Video of working prototype
* Screenshots
* Code repository where prototype is stored
