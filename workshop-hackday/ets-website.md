# Hackdays
Hackdays are how Emerging Technology can work with a client to explore a problem, or new technology, by building a working prototype. They are a way to generate new solutions or to quickly test a technology's potential. Building rapid prototypes is the best way we have to fully understand a problem and reduce the risks in using an unproven technology.

When Emerging Technology run a hackday we provide a set of technology experts who are adept at learning new technologies and can build prototypes fast. The client provides developers with industry knowledge. The combined development team will work together to create a prototype. This is usually over a one or two day period.

A hackday can be tailored to a client's needs, but they are typically 1-2 days long. As well as a working prototype, the Emerging Technology team will work with the client to produce a plan for taking the prototypes through further development or to production.

## When to run a hackday
Hackdays are best used when a client wants to experiment with a new technology or look at different solutions. They rely on general development skill from the client, but not necessarily any knowledge of the technology that is the focus of the hackday.
