## Rapid Prototyping
Hackdays are one way that you can work with Emerging Technology to explore a problem (or a new technology) by developing a working prototype. They are a means to generate new solutions or to quickly test a technology's potential. Building rapid prototypes is the best way we have to fully understand a problem and reduce the risks in using an unproven technology.

## What we Offer
Emerging Technology will facilitate, run and contribute developers to your hackday. We can host the event at our [Hursley lab](http://www-05.ibm.com/uk/locations/hursley.html) or run it on your site.

When Emerging Technology run a hackday we provide a set of technology experts who are adept at learning new technologies and can build prototypes fast. You contribute developers (1-12) with industry knowledge. The combined development team will work together to create a prototype.

A hackday can be tailored to a your needs, but they are typically 1-2 days long. As well as a working prototype, the Emerging Technology team will help you to produce a plan for taking the prototype through further development or on to production.

Hackdays are best used when a you want to experiment with a new technology or look at different solutions to  known problems. They rely on general development skill from the client, but not necessarily any knowledge of the technology that is the focus of the hackday.

## A hackday looks like...
Before the workshop one of our technologists will work with you to plan the days, helping to define the problem or technology that will be the focus. We match the problem area or technology with Emerging Technology developers and spread them amongst your teams (we find 2-3 developers per team works best). The workshops normally start with a brief introduction to the problem or technology focus and we set out the timetable for playbacks and demos (normally at the end of each day).  

The rest of the workshop is left for the joint development teams to work together on their hacks. You'll find a mixture of focussed concentration and lively teamwork throughout the sessions and often friendly competition between teams. The final playback allows each group to demonstrate their working prototype.

At the end of two days of ideas and hacks we'll have a set of working prototypes. These are often useful in their own right to prove (or disprove) a technology, to help sell the idea and to scope out what work would be required to go from the prototype to a production system.  The Emerging Technology developers will work with you to plan what needs to happen next.
