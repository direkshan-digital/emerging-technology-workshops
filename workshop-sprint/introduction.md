# Sprint Workshop
The workshop is over two days, but with a three day gap between for prototype development to take place. The first day is a design session for the client and Emerging Technology developers to define the problem, technology and prototype that will be built.  The developers will then spend three days building the prototype for a playback with the client on day five. Ideally the playback will be done in person, but it can be done virtually if necessary.

## When to do a sprint workshop
* You want to prototype using a new technology or data set quickly, but do not have the technical resource to do so.
* The participants are not developers.

## When not to do a sprint workshop
* The prototype is bigger than something that can be built in 3 days.
* The problem and solution cannot be clearly defined.

## What clients get from a sprint workshop
* A better understanding of a technology or data set.
* Reduction in risk of using a new technology or data set.

## Output
A working prototype

## How many client participants can there be
1-6

## Cost
5 person days
