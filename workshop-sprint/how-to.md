# How To Run A Sprint Workshop
A sprint workshop has the user focussed design elements of a Design Workshop and the end result of a working prototype from a Hackday Workshop, without the client providing developers.


## Attendees
The attendees are similar to those who would take part in a Design Workshop, but more limited in terms of numbers (1-4 from the client). Ideally, there should be range of people involved: developers, operations and people from the business. Most important is someone to represent the users experiencing the problem that has been identified. Ideally this would be the person who has the problem directly but if that’s not possible a proxy can be used. This is someone who has enough experience of the problem to represent the user.  

From Emerging Technology there would normally be one or two people participating in the workshop.  They would be responsible for running the workshop, developing the prototype and presenting it back.


## Requirements
* A1 Post-it notes
* Normal Post-it notes
* Sharpies
* Materials for paper prototypes (paper, coloured pens, scissors)


## Expected Outcome
Working prototype to be presented back to client on second part of the workshop.


## What to do before the workshop
* Run through with the client how the day(s) will be organised. Help to set their expectation of what the outcome is likely to be given the time and problem they are trying to tackle.
* Make sure there is at least one user (or proxy user) who will attend.
* Book a room with plenty of wall space for charts and make sure there's plenty of post-its, sharpies.


## How to run the workshop
The aim of the first day of the workshop is to get enough information and clarity from the client on the prototype to be built. This will be the only real opportunity for the developers to get this information before presenting their prototype back to the client in the second part of the workshop.  The aim should be to finish the day with a paper prototype.

Different approaches can be taken on how to get to this stage. It may be that the client has a clear idea of exactly what they want. In this case get them to explain the idea and sketch out on paper how it would work and how the user would interact with the system and produce a paper prototype.  

If the client has a clear idea of the problem, but not the solution or what the prototype would look like, work through the first four Design Thinking stages (user persona, as-is scenario, idea generation and idea impact v feasibility). This should generate enough ideas and help select one that balances impact with feasibility.  You can then go on and create a paper prototype from this idea.

Once a paper prototype has been produced, this will be enough to let the developers spend a minimum of three days developing a working prototype from it. The developers will judge how much of it can be 'real' and how much should be mocked up.  This will then be presented back to the client on the second day of the workshop.  This second day can either be in person or done virtually.  The developers should run through the prototype explaining any decisions they've made and if possible allow the client to try out the prototype for themselves.


## What can go wrong
* The participants have less understanding of the user than they thought. It is difficult to accurately get at the real problem in this case, but can be useful alone in showing the lack of understanding.
* The solution isn't something that can be prototyped. Solutions that take the form on a user interface are generally easy to prototype. You may need to mock some parts of the system up, but you can generally build something that shows how the solution would work from a user's perspective.  Some solutions, however, might not take this form, they might be a non-IT solution, a physical object or a hidden algorithm.  In this case, work with the client to figure out how to best take the idea forward.  It could be in producing a storyboard, a video, or presentation.

## Suggested Agenda
### Day 1
#### Introductions (10 minutes)
* Individual introductions.
* What ETS is.
* What Design Thinking is.
* What we’re going to do over the two days, examples of what we’ve done with it before.
* Customer Introduction / Problem Explanation

#### Personas (30 minutes)
This is the first step to understanding the problem we’re working on.  This is where we focus on the person or people who experience the problem we’re working on.  This is largely to give the people not familiar with the problem as full an understanding as possible.

#### Break (10 minutes)

#### As-Is Scenario (30 minutes)
In this we map out the problems in terms of what the user needs to do. Essentially it is a flow of the task they’re trying to complete with the problems. We often find this useful as it shows the problem in the task isn’t always what we intuitively think it is, or there are multiple problems in the task, or different people have a different view on what the problem in the task is.

#### Ideas (40 minutes)
We work on ideas that address the problems that came out of the As-Is scenario. This is where we’d get to introduce emerging technology if it’s appropriate, but we generally find everyone can contribute to this part.  We then filter down the ideas using guidance of impact and feasibility to work out the ones that are the most appropriate to focus on for the rest of the workshop.

#### Lunch (60 minutes)

#### Ideas Feasibility/Impact and Selection (20 minutes)
Use an impact against feasibility graph to help decide which ideas are worth taking forward.  May need to do voting to help decide.  Need to decide on one idea to take forward to day two.

#### Paper Prototypes (90 minutes)

#### Paper Prototypes Playback (10 minutes)
Present summary from each group and the idea they’re going to work through the following day.

#### Wrap Up (10 minutes)
Explanation of what the developers are going to do over the next few days and what to expect to be presented back with.

### Day 5

#### Recap (30 minutes)
Summary of what happened in the first day of the workshop, what the key findings were, what ideas were developed and the plan for the prototype was.

#### Prototype Playback (60 minutes)
Demo, and chance for client to try the prototype out.  Capture feedback and questions as you go.

#### Wrap Up / Next Steps (30 minutes)
What needs to happen next?  Can/should the idea to take the idea forward? What does a path to production look like? What will be needed in terms of resource, cost and time?
