# How To Run A Design Thinking Workshop

## Aim

## Resources

## Requirements
1. A defined problem.
2. A real user.
3. Input from different areas of the client's business.

## Expected Outcome

## Attendees
Ideally there should be range of people from the client: developers, operations and people from the business. Most important is someone to represent the users experiencing the problem that has been identified. Ideally this would be the person who has the problem directly but if that’s not possible a proxy can be used. This is someone who has enough experience of the problem to represent the user.

From Emerging Technology we’d bring in people depending on the number of attendees. We’d normally break down the sessions in to groups of around four and we would have one ETS person in each group.

## Suggested Two Day Agenda
### Day 1
#### Introductions (40 minutes)
* Individual introductions.
* What ETS is.
* What Design Thinking is.
* What we’re going to do over the two days, examples of what we’ve done with it before.
* Customer Introduction / Problem Explanation

#### Personas (60 minutes)
This is the first step to understanding the problem we’re working on.  This is where we focus on the person or people who experience the problem we’re working on.  This is largely to give the people not familiar with the problem as full an understanding as possible.

For a two day Design Thinknig workshop, it is possible to explore several persons

#### Break (10 minutes)

#### As-Is Scenario (60 minutes)
In this we map out the problems in terms of what the user needs to do. Essentially it is a flow of the task they’re trying to complete with the problems. We often find this useful as it shows the problem in the task isn’t always what we intuitively think it is, or there are multiple problems in the task, or different people have a different view on what the problem in the task is.

An ‘As-Is’ scenario map should be produced for each persona that has been identified.

#### Lunch (60 minutes)

#### Ideas (60 minutes)
We work on ideas that address the problems that came out of the As-Is scenario. This is where we’d get to introduce emerging technology if it’s appropriate, but we generally find everyone can contribute to this part.  We then filter down the ideas using guidance of impact and feasibility to work out the ones that are the most appropriate to focus on for the rest of the workshop.

#### Ideas Feasibility/Impact and Selection (60 minutes)
Use an impact against feasilbiltiy graph to help decide which ideas are worth taking forward.  May need to do voting to help decide.  Need to decide on one idea to take forward to day two.

#### Break (10 minutes)

#### Playback (40 minutes)
Present summary from each group and the idea they’re going to work through the following day.

### Day 2
#### To-Be Scenario (1 hour)
We map out the ideas we’ve selected in to a flow of how the task will be completed if the new ideas were implemented.  This complements the As-Is scenario and makes sure everyone’s understanding of the idea is the same.  This is important as people often interpret the same idea or technology as something different.

#### Break (10 minutes)

#### Who What Why & Hills Definition (1 hour)
Work to put the scenario in terms of a who a what and a why.  Should be a single statement that defines the idea.  Hills can be defined from this to document what it is you want to take forward

#### Lunch (60 minutes)

#### Paper Prototype (2 hours)

#### Break (10 minutes)

#### Playbacks (40 minutes)

#### Wrap Up and Next Steps (20 minutes)

## Output
We’d capture and writeup the sessions to give to the customer.  These can be useful on their own as a reminder of problems and solutions that we didn’t have time to fully explore in the two days.

Prototype(s) - this could be paper based, mockup on screens or a working system depending on the people involved.  There might be multiple prototypes depending on the numbers involved and the scope of the problem.

Outline plan for how we’d take the idea forward (what needs to be done next).
