# Design Workshops
Design workshops allow Emerging Technology developers and designers to work with a client on a specific user problem. We use IBM's Design Thinking process to understand user needs and process and develop solutions that meet those need. A design workshop is completely focussed around users. They are hands-on sessions that encourage a better understanding of a user and often are responsible for generating new ideas or solutions. At a minimum they help to better understand a client's users.

The Emerging Technology team have experience of applying Design Thinking to real problems, but are also skilled technologists. The background technical knowledge often allows them to propose novel solutions. The client provides expert industry knowledge and understanding of the target user.

The format of a design workshop will be tailored to a specific client. They are typically 2 days long, though they can be shorter or longer depending on the scope of the problem to be addressed. The output of each workshop will be different, but can include: maps of the user persona and problems, documented ideas, feasibility assessments and prototypes.

## When to run a design workshop
A design workshop is best applied when there is a specific user problem you are looking to address. They require detailed knowledge about the problem and users from the client, but not necessarily any development expertise.
