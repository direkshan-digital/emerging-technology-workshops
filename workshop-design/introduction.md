# Design Workshop
A one or two day workshop where we take a specific user problem and design a solution or a set of solutions to it.  We use IBM's Design Thinking process to understand user needs, map out the the task the user is attempting and come up with solutions that meet that need.  

A design workshop is completely focussed around users.  It will be a hands-on session that encourages full participation and input from everyone taking part.

[How to run a design workshop](how-to.md)

## When to do a design workshop
* If there is an identified user problem to be solved.
* You are open to any solution (which might not be a technology based one).
* The participants have a range of skills and backgrounds.
* A real user experiencing the problem (or a proxy for them) can take part in the workshop.

## When not to do a design workshop
* A problem has not been identified.
* There is no access to a real user.
* A decision about a specific technology or solution has already been taken.
* All participants cannot be in the same physical location.

## What clients get from a design workshop
* A better understanding of their users and the problem.
* Chance to explore a set of solutions they may not have considered.
* Opportunity to get technology insight from the Emerging Technology team.
* The chance to try out Design Thinking.

## Output
The output can vary based on client needs and the type of solution arrived at. Typical outputs include: a statement of the solution, a workflow describing how the user will make use the solution, a prototype or mockup.

## How many client participants can there be
1-12

## Cost
1-10 person days depending on the number of client participants and how many days the workshop runs for.
